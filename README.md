# ebinnion dotfiles :)

Over the past few years, I've built up a list of aliases, scripts, and config files that are a bit scattered. This repository is an effort to bring some organization to my development environment.

This repository is intended for use by me, so you may not find it too helpful. :)

If you're interested in dotfiles, have a look at [https://dotfiles.github.io/](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
