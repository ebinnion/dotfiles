# Superpowers

A collection of skills for AI coding agents that implement structured development workflows. These skills are sourced from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).

## Overview

Superpowers provides a methodical approach to software development that emphasizes planning, collaboration, and quality over immediately jumping into code. The system treats coding as a structured workflow with multiple phases.

## Key Capabilities

- **Brainstorming** - Interactive design refinement that clarifies requirements before implementation
- **Planning** - Breaking work into manageable tasks with specific deliverables
- **Test-driven development** - Enforcing a red-green-refactor cycle
- **Subagent coordination** - Running multiple AI agents concurrently on different tasks
- **Code review** - Checking work against specifications
- **Systematic debugging** - Structured root-cause analysis techniques

## Philosophy

- Write tests before code
- Process-driven approaches over ad-hoc solutions
- Simplicity as a primary design goal
- Verification through evidence rather than assumptions
